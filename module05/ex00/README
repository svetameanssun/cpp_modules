1.  + Create exeption class file  (instead of canonical)
2.  + Mark setGrade as commented
3. + Check Exception work NOW
4. + A question: if I try to intit an object like that : Bureaucrat buro("any", 1555),
    it will throw an exception.
    ---> But will it initialize the object? I think Yes, it will,
    but I am NOT SURE. CHECK! <-------
    P.S. - checked, it deletes the object
5. Readable code
6. Check leaks ?
7. Should exeption class belong to the Bureaucrat class? Why?
8. HOW does the code understand that It has to use the destructor???
